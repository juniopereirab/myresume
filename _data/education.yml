    During my time at UnB, I learnt and I am learning everything that I know, and I need to know about software engineering, and all stuff about documentation and programming paradigms. I am really engaged about what I can do, to make the world better, and it's just seems incredible.

    I have worked as cheerleading and clubs advisor at College Athletic, and it was wonderful because I improve my teamwork experiences.
